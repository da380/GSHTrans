 * serialises every region the body goes on to open and nothing else. It is
 * scoped to the team's implicit tasks and the caller's own setting is as it

 *
 * Opening the team is not enough by itself, though it was once thought to be.
 * The argument was that a region opened inside a region is nested, and that
 * the default of one active level makes a nested region serial. That holds
 * for a team of two or more. A team of **one** is an *inactive* region: it
 * does not count as a level, `omp_in_parallel()` is false inside it, and a
 * region opened from it gets the whole machine -- so the sequential case,
 * which is the one that was measured and the one most callers run, was

/**
 * @brief How a batch of same-spin fields is laid out in the caller's storage.
 *
 * @details The batched transform's primitive is "transform @f$k@f$ fields
 * sharing a grid, a degree and an upper index", with the single field as
 * @f$k = 1@f$. What varies between callers is not how many fields there are
 * but how they are arranged, so a batch is described by
 * `(count, stride, dist)` rather than by contiguity: element @f$j@f$ of field
 * @f$k@f$ lives at `j * stride + k * dist`.
 *
 * This is FFTW's advanced-interface form, and it is used because it costs
 * nothing at the stage that actually reads the caller's layout — the FFT —
 * while covering both arrangements the field layer produces: a radial slab or
 * component-major tensor components, which are `stride = 1`,
 * `dist = FieldSize`; and point-major tensor components, which are
 * `stride = nComponents`, `dist = 1`. The second is why this is a decision
 * rather than a detail: without it the field layer would have to promise
 * component-major storage and repack anything else before transforming.
 *
 * Full FFTW `nembed` generality is deliberately not offered, since the
 * angular layout is fixed by the grid and most of it would be unreachable.
 *
 * A batch shares grid, degree and upper index. The Wigner block for that
 * upper index is precisely what batching amortises, so fields at different
 * upper indices cannot batch together — for a rank-2 tensor that means
 * batching over radii within each @f$n@f$, not across components.

   * storage with padding between elements or with duplicated interface nodes,
   * the components of a tensor that share an upper index in a caller's own
   * array. Field @f$k@f$ starts at `offsets[k]` and its elements are @p stride
   * apart, so element @f$j@f$ of it is at `offsets[k] + j * stride`. The
   * offsets need be in no particular order.
   *
   * It costs the transform nothing to admit this, and no kernel changed to do
   * it. A layout is reached only through Count(), Stride(), Offset(), Span()
   * and Disjoint(), and every field is gathered into the library's own
   * scratch before FFTW or a BLAS is given anything, so neither ever meets the
   * caller's layout.
   *
   * **The batch owns its offsets**, as a table shared between its copies and
   * never changed, so a Batch stays an ordinary value: it can be stored,
   * returned, and outlive whatever it was made from. FFTW's guru interface
   * borrows its tables instead. That is free, and the way it goes wrong here
   * is a transform that *writes* through a table which has since gone --
   * silently, into whatever is there. The copy that prevents it is one
   * reference count when a Batch is copied, which is a dozen times a
   * transform and never once per element.
   *
   * Disjointness is checked here and not in the transform, which is why the

 * forward transform's weak point at high thread counts, deleted rather than
 * tuned.
 *
 * **Both are kept, permanently.** This is not a migration with a flag day: the
 * point of the two coexisting is measurement. A GEMM sums in whatever order
 * its kernel chooses, so the matrix path cannot be bit-compared against the
 * loop path — but it can be compared to a tolerance, on identical inputs,
 * which is a check of the layout, the indexing, the FFT ordering and the
 * accumulation that no single-kernel library has available. It also means the
 * right kernel for a machine is a question that machine can answer for itself.
 *
 * A property of the grid rather than of the call, for the reason WignerValues
 * is: the two layouts are mutually exclusive, and 648 MB at
 * @f$l_{\max} = 256@f$ with @f$n_{\max} = 2@f$ is not a thing to hold twice.
 *
 * Matrix() is *absent*, not merely refused, in a build without BLAS, so asking
 * for it there is a compile error at the call site rather than a throw at grid
 * construction. That is the tighter of the two options and the reversible one:
 * offering it later with a runtime throw breaks nobody, while withdrawing it
 * would.
 *
 * Matrix() with WignerValues::Generated() is refused at grid construction, and
 * that is a fact about the recursion rather than an unimplemented case. The
 * recursion's output for one @f$(n, \theta)@f$ spans every order at once, so
 * isolating the single @f$(n, m)@f$ block a per-order product wants means
 * either keeping all of it — which is the table, and not having one is the
 * entire purpose of generating — or re-running the recursion once per order.

 * band-limited field and safe at the poles, and costs @f$O(l_{\max}^2)@f$ a
 * point. Bilinear() and Bicubic() are rectilinear schemes over the field's own
 * samples, which cost @f$O(1)@f$ a point and are not exact; they are *absent*,
 * not refused, in a build without the interpolation dependency.
 *
 * This policy differs from the others here in one respect. They are values
 * read at run time by code that is the same either way. These three select
 * between interpolants of *different types* — one holds an expansion, the
 * others hold upstream objects with their own coefficient arrays — so
 * Interpolate must dispatch at compile time and return a scheme-dependent
 * type. The named constructors therefore return distinct tag types rather than
 * a common value type, which keeps the caller's spelling identical to the
 * other policies while making the dispatch overload resolution.
 *
 * What that costs: a scheme cannot be chosen from a configuration file without
 * a switch in the caller's own code.
